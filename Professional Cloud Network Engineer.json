As a first step in the migration, you want to create a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with an external HTTP(S) load balancer. This load balancer will forward traffic back to the on-premises compute resources that run the presentation tier. You need to stop malicious traffic from entering your VPC and consuming resources at the edge, so you must configure this policy to filter IP addresses and stop cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. What should you do?",
